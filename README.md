# Rest-API
## My API Rest simple project (I used postman to proof all method). Using Node JS. I implemented methods like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE. Also, I used MongoDB as database to give functionality to all methods.

### To start creating an API Rest, just type the following commands:
### 1). npm init -y (-Y to accept all default settings)
### 2). npm install -S express (-S to save the express dependence)
### 3). npm i -S mongoose (This is a MongoDB library to connect easier with the cloud server)
