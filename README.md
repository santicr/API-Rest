# Rest-API
## My Rest API simple project (I used postman to proof all method). Using Node JS. I implemented methods like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE. Also, I used MongoDB as database to give functionality to all methods.

### To start creating an API Rest, just type the following commands:
### 1). npm init -y (-Y to accept all default settings)
### 2). npm install -S express (-S to save the express dependence)
### 3). npm i -S mongoose (This is a MongoDB library to connect easier with the cloud server)

## What did I learn?
### Summary:
### I learnt, how to connect an app to database using MongoDB (free version), how to create a simple database (users), how to delete and add items to users database using Node JS. Also, imlementation of methods (GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE AND POST).
